# Deployment Guide

Follow these steps to publish your CANSLIM screener app:

1. **Create a new GitHub repository** for your project (e.g., `canslim-screener`).
2. **Push your code** to GitHub using Git or upload files via the web interface.
3. **Sign in to Streamlit Cloud** with your GitHub account.
4. Click **New app**, select your repository and branch, and specify the main file path (`app.py`).
5. Click **Deploy!**

After a few minutes, Streamlit will build and deploy your app. You will receive a URL such as `https://canslim-screener.streamlit.app` where the application will be publicly available.

For more information, see the official Streamlit [deployment guide](https://docs.streamlit.io/streamlit-community-cloud).
